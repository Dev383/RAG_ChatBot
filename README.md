# Political Manifesto Q&A Chatbot

Welcome to the Political Manifesto Q&A Chatbot repository! This project features a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) based language model (LLM) chatbot designed to answer questions based on a given political manifesto. Leveraging advanced natural language processing capabilities, the chatbot can provide informed responses by referencing the content of the manifesto.

## Overview

The Political Manifesto Q&A Chatbot uses a combination of retrieval and generation techniques to provide accurate and contextually relevant answers to user queries. The chatbot is designed to help users understand and explore the contents of a political manifesto by answering specific questions about it.

## Features

- **Retrieval-Augmented Generation**: Combines retrieval of relevant passages from the manifesto with generative language modeling to create comprehensive answers.
- **Context-Aware Responses**: Understands and maintains context to provide relevant answers to follow-up questions.
- **Customizable**: Easily update the chatbot to use different political manifestos.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for interacting with the chatbot.

## Installation

To get started, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Dev383/RAG_ChatBot.git
    cd RAG_Chatbot
    ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**:
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. **Install the required dependencies**:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. **Download the pre-trained language model and any necessary data** (specific instructions will depend on the model used).

## Usage

1. **Prepare the political manifesto**: Ensure the political manifesto is in a text file (e.g., `manifesto.txt`). This file will be used as the knowledge base for the chatbot.

2. **Start the chatbot**:
    ```bash
    python app.py --manifesto_path path/to/manifesto.txt
    ```

3. **Interact with the chatbot**: Use the provided interface to ask questions related to the political manifesto. The chatbot will respond based on the content of the manifesto.

## Configuration

You can configure various aspects of the chatbot by modifying the `config.yaml` file. This includes settings for the language model, retrieval parameters, and interface options.

## Model Training

If you want to fine-tune the language model or retrain it on new data, follow these steps:

1. **Prepare training data**: Ensure you have a dataset of question-answer pairs relevant to the political manifesto.

2. **Update the chatbot configuration**: Point the chatbot to the newly trained model in the `config.yaml` file.
